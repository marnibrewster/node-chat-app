# Node chat app built with socket.io

P2P Chat app created as part of [Andrew Mead's Complete Node Developer Course.](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/learn/v4/)
Utilizing socket.io, jquery, moment.js, and mustache, this app allows users to create a username and chat room name. They can then share that room name with whomever else, and carry on private or group chats.
